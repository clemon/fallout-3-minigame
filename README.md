# fallout-hacking-minigame
When your lock-picking skills aren't quite up to par, how do you break in? Uh, obviously hack the terminal...

Joking aside, this is a command line emulation of the "terminal hacking" minigame from Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3.

Heres an example: 
```
Difficulty (1-5)? 3

  SCORPION
  FLOGGING
  CROPPERS
  MIGRAINE
  FOOTNOTE
  REFINERY
  VAULTING
  VICARAGE
  PROTRACT
  DESCENTS

Guess (4 left)? migraine
  0/8 correct
Guess (3 left)? protract
  2/8 correct
Guess (2 left)? croppers
  8/8 correct
You win!
```
